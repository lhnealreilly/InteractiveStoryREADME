## üåü What Makes This Special?

This isn't just a README - it's a **fully interactive RPG adventure game** that lives entirely within GitHub's markdown system. No external websites, no JavaScript, no installations required. Just pure markdown magic powered by AI-driven storytelling and creative use of GitHub's image proxy system.

### üéØ The Innovation
By leveraging GitHub's image serving mechanism, **Google Gemini AI**, and dynamic PNG generation, we've created something quite interesting: A fully functional choose your own adventure that lives entierely withing a README.md file.

### ‚≠ê Revolutionary Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Storytelling**: Google Gemini Flash generates unique, contextual story scenes in real-time
- **üéÆ Full RPG System**: Health, gold, items, leveling, and permanent character progression
- **üìñ Story Continuity**: Each scene includes a summary of what happened, creating seamless narrative flow
- **üé≤ Infinite Adventures**: Every choice could create new, never-before-seen story paths
- **üíÄ Death Mechanics**: Real stakes - lose all progress if your health reaches zero

---

## üéÆ The Adventure Begins

*Welcome to an AI-powered adventure where every choice matters. Your character has health, gold, and items that persist throughout your journey. Choose wisely - death resets everything, but victory brings rewards and progression through an infinite, procedurally generated world...*

### üé≠ Your Character Stats
*Displayed live on every scene - watch your health, gold, and items change based on your choices!*

## üéÆ RPG Character System

### üìä Player Statistics

Your character progression is automatically saved and displayed on every scene:

- **‚ù§Ô∏è Health System**: Start with 100 HP, lose health in combat, gain from healing
- **üí∞ Gold Economy**: Earn gold from victories, spend on items, lose from failures
- **‚≠ê Experience & Leveling**: Gain XP from all actions, level up every 100 XP
- **üéí Dynamic Inventory**: Collect theme-specific items that enhance your abilities
- **üèÜ Permanent Progression**: All stats persist until death resets everything

---

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Story Generation

### üß† Google Gemini Integration

Every new scene is generated using **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** with structured output:

```python
class GeneratedScene(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str
    summary: str  # What happened between scenes
    background_color: str
    choice_a: SceneChoice
    choice_b: SceneChoice
```

### üìñ Contextual Story Creation

The AI receives rich context for every scene generation:

```python
context = f"""
Previous scene: "{prev_title}"
Player chose: "{choice_text}"
Current stats: Health {health}/{max_health}, Gold {gold}, Level {level}
Items: {', '.join(items)}
"""
```

## üìä Global Adventure Metrics

The adventure tracks collective player data:

## üèóÔ∏è Create Your Own Adventure

Want to build your own interactive README? Here's how:

### Prerequisites
- **AWS CLI** configured with appropriate permissions
- **Python 3.10+** installed locally
- **Google AI API Key** - Get yours at [https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
- **AWS Account** with Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB access

### 1. Set Up the Backend
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/interactive-story-readme.git
cd interactive-story-readme/backend

# Add your Google AI API key to .env file
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# Make the deployment script executable
chmod +x deploy.sh

# Deploy to AWS (this will create everything needed)
./deploy.sh
```

The deployment script will:
- **Install AI Dependencies**: Google Gemini AI, Pydantic for structured output
- **Create Lambda Function**: With Pillow and Pydantic layers for image generation and AI integration
- **Set up API Gateway**: Binary media type configuration for PNG responses
- **Create DynamoDB Tables**: Game state, statistics, and AI-generated story scenes
- **Configure IAM Roles**: Full permissions for DynamoDB and external API access
- **Output API Endpoints**: Ready-to-use URLs for your README integration

### 2. Design Your README
```markdown
# Your Adventure Title

![Scene](https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scene.png)

## Choose Your Path
[![Option A](https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/option/a.png)](https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/choice/a)
[![Option B](https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/option/b.png)](https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/choice/b)

![Stats](https://YOUR-API-ID.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/stats.png)
```

### 3. Customize Your Adventure

**ü§ñ AI-Powered Generation (Recommended)**
The system automatically generates infinite unique stories using Google Gemini AI. No manual story writing required! Just configure themes and let AI create contextual, engaging scenes.

**üé® Theme Configuration**
Edit `lambda_function.py` to customize story themes:
```python
STORY_THEMES = {
    'your_theme': {
        'locations': ['space station', 'alien world', 'cybercity'],
        'creatures': ['robot', 'alien', 'cyborg'],
        'objects': ['laser gun', 'computer', 'spaceship'],
        'colors': ['#0d47a1', '#1a237e', '#4a148c']
    }
}
```

**‚öôÔ∏è Player Progression Settings**
Adjust RPG mechanics in the `INITIAL_PLAYER_STATE` and `STATE_DELTAS` configurations to balance difficulty, rewards, and progression speed.

### 4. Redeploy Changes
```bash
# After editing the story or code
./deploy.sh

# The script will update your existing Lambda function
```

### 5. Troubleshooting

**ü§ñ AI Generation Issues**
- **Google AI API Errors**: Verify your API key in `.env` and check quotas at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
- **Fallback System**: If Gemini fails, the system automatically uses procedural generation
- **Rate Limiting**: Gemini Flash has generous limits, but consider caching for high-traffic adventures

**üñºÔ∏è Image Display Problems**
- **Base64 Text**: Deployment script configures binary media types automatically
- **Cache Issues**: GitHub proxy caches aggressively - add `?v=timestamp` parameters
- **Large Images**: Optimize image size in Pillow settings if Lambda timeouts occur

**‚ö° Performance Optimization**
- **Lambda Cold Starts**: Consider provisioned concurrency for instant response
- **DynamoDB Throttling**: Upgrade from on-demand to provisioned throughput if needed
- **CloudWatch Monitoring**: `aws logs tail /aws/lambda/interactive-adventure --follow`

**üîß Development & Testing**
- **Local Testing**: Use `python3 test_player_state.py` to verify RPG mechanics
- **AI Testing**: Run Gemini integration tests with your API key
- **Database Inspection**: Check DynamoDB console for scene generation and player state

**Testing locally:**
```bash
cd backend
python3 test_images.py  # Generates test images to verify Pillow works
```

## üìà Performance & Scale

### Handling GitHub's Proxy System

**The Challenge**: GitHub's image proxy caches aggressively
**The Solution**: Strategic cache headers and URL versioning

```python
# Lambda function sets cache-busting headers
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'image/png',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache',
    'Expires': '0',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
}

# README URLs include version parameters
# https://api-id.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/scene.png?v=1
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Image Generation**: <500ms average (Lambda cold start included)
- **Story Processing**: <100ms per choice
- **Concurrent Players**: Scales automatically with AWS Lambda
- **Uptime**: 99.9%+ (AWS infrastructure)
- **Cost**: Pay-per-request serverless pricing
